# Description

My motivation for this was to create a time table in order to test my skills in javascript and to expand my portfolio.

1: Download repo from github 2: Save where desired 3: Open file with a text editor of your choice

For accessing the website rather than the code follow these instructions:

1: Copy link provided in this README

# Usage

1: Type a note in any of the text boxes
2: Click on the lock that is on the right of your chosen text box

Note that the planner is time based; the current hour is coloured red, upcoming hours are green, and hours that have passed already are grey.
